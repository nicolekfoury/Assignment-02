# Pilot-Test


#### Introduction:

MyHealthfinder is a website that provides information on various health-related topics related to health, including doctor visits, everyday living, and pregnancy. The user can search various health conditions, learn about medical testing/screening processes, and read articles detailing information about all of the main categories mentioned previously. The site is coordinated by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and aims for users to have general health-related questions answered in an efficient manner. 
 
After conducting a heuristic evaluation on MyHealthFinder, several concerns emerged regarding usability. Firstly, the website is inconsistent in the ways it displays system status; only a select amount of things provide feedback to the user. MyHealthFinder could also be more developed to match its system to the real world in terms of the familiarity of its home page format. Lastly, the site could greatly expand on helping users recognize and recover from errors in usability, as well as documentation of said errors. 

Given these issues, I will administer a usability test to fully grasp how much the potential design issues I have mentioned previously affects users in their ability to perform whatever tasks they wish to on the website. The test will strive to display the efficiency, clarity, and overall satisfaction of MyHealthfinder. 

#### Methodology:
Due to the concerns surrounding the pandemic, the moderator and participant will be in contact remotely, through a Zoom call. Prior to the Zoom meeting, the participant has been mailed a consent form and given informed consent in order to proceed without any breaches of privacy. Once entering the usability test, The participant has been mailed all of the links (in chronological order) to the survey questions, including a background questionnaire, pre and post-test questionnaire, and finally, a demographics questionnaire. Additionally, they have this overview document to help guide them along the process. I will walk them through step by step as they navigate each of the tasks I have decided will most accurately shed light on the usability concerns I was suspicious of.  The pilot usability test will be conducted with the participant and moderator in a quiet office setting, only communicating with each other throughout the test. The participant will communicate their thoughts to the moderator as they navigate each task, and complete the surveys. Upon answering the survey questions, they will communicate their thoughts to the moderator as they click through the surveys. Finally, they will fill out the demographics form, and the test will be over.

#### Reflection:
The pilot usability test shed a very insightful perspective about the usability of MyHealthfinder and the testing process within itself. In terms of the website itself, the participant confirmed most of my previous concerns were accurate. In accordance with my heuristic evaluation, there were clear issues with inconsistent visual feedback, redundant page information, and a need for a help/error page for users to navigate the website. The participant was very opinionated about the main menu tab on the homepage, and how this system is not in accordance with the outside world as it is not formatted to default homepage guidelines. To summarize, the participantâ€™s issues navigating the website and completing the tasks I set out emphasizes that MyHealthfinder.gov is strongly urged to improve in many facets of usability.

In addition to the usability test results, the process was very revealing to me in terms of what I need to work on as a moderator, and the reality of the experience. Already knowing the likely outcome of the tasks I assigned, I felt an urge to overshare hints to the participant, which could be perceived as rushing them, and consequently distorting their perception of the website. I also noticed that I improvised my speech instead of strictly sticking to the script in order to seem more natural and approachable to the participant, and put them at ease. While my tone and demeanor were calming, I noticed that the way I worded questions could reveal implicit biases during certain moments. In those instances, I would instantly correct myself by also stating an alternative opinion for the participant to choose from, so that they were not only fed a one-sided question. Nevertheless, I feel that my wording as a moderator is something that I could strongly improve on. 

In general, I felt that the pilot usability test was mostly successful. The links were functional, and easy to navigate, and Zoom was a seamless way to effectively communicate. The participant was very enthusiastic and thorough in her answers and efforts throughout the test, which I highly appreciated. The participant was constantly providing insight to every thought she had, and was respectful, efficient, and calm despite the difficulty of certain tasks. The primary concern I had about the test would be my communication as a moderator, and making sure that I present myself as unbiased as possible.
