# Pilot-Test


#### Introduction:

MyHealthfinder is a website that provides information on various health-related topics related to health, including doctor visits, everyday living, and pregnancy. The user can search various health conditions, learn about medical testing/screening processes, and read articles detailing information about all of the main categories mentioned previously. The site is coordinated by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and aims for users to have general health-related questions answered in an efficient manner. 
 
After conducting a heuristic evaluation on MyHealthFinder, several concerns emerged regarding usability. Firstly, the website is inconsistent in the ways it displays system status; only a select amount of things provide feedback to the user. MyHealthFinder could also be more developed to match its system to the real world in terms of the familiarity of its home page format. Lastly, the site could greatly expand on helping users recognize and recover from errors in usability, as well as documentation of said errors. 

Given these issues, I will administer a usability test to fully grasp how much the potential design issues I have mentioned previously affects users in their ability to perform whatever tasks they wish to on the website. The test will strive to display the efficiency, clarity, and overall satisfaction of MyHealthfinder.
